NBviewerPermalink

A free tool maintained by the Jupyter project, NBviewer is an online service that renders static Jupyter Notebooks from URLs. If you supply NBviewer with a URL that points to a GitHub repository, you can navigate the repository structure from NBviewer and select notebooks to view.

One limitation of NBviewer is that your notebooks must be publicly available. If you’re working in a private GitHub repository, you can’t use NBviewer.
